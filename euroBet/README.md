## Help me

- [ ] I don't know how to implement this imagebackground on all stacks, for some
reason it doesn't pass down to the StackNavigator child from the TabNavigator
parent,thats why I had to use ImageBackground on all screens inside StackNavigator.

- [ ] I only got images twice the pixel of the PSD so I had to divide all Image
heights and widths of 2.
